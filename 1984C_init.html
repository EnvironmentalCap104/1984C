The October surprise of getting the hostages out of Iran saved Jimmy Carter's political career. Stagflation has dropped, but that doesn't mean Carter has gotten any more popular.

On the Republican side, Kansas Senator Bob Dole, the 1976 Republican vice presidential nominee, gets the Republican nomination. Can Mondale continue the Carter years? Or is the country ready for a change and will it go for Bob Dole?",

Maybe that's what the Republicans need to defeat the liberal Mondale, after it didn't work with a strong conservative like Ronny. Will his efforts be successful? Or will he fall to Fritz? </p>",

He has great skills in prosecution, after he tried and convicted the top aides of the big boss, Richard C. Daley, in a bipartisan manner. Thompson could be a great asset if you want to take a law-and-order approach to your 1984 campaign.</p>",

His canvassing tour during the primaries gave him a lot of momentum, but again, you were always the favorite. He's got the youth and grassroots campaignign experience that might just be necessary to hold the White House for the Democrats in 1984. He is also known as an \"Atari Democrat\", after cosponsoring the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, which may or may not help you in certain areas. In terms of geography, Colorado always leaned towards Dole, but he can help you gain ground there, and the rest of the West including the golden prize of Ronald Reagan's California.</p>",

His great-grandfather's corporation is very famous for its ketchup and relish. But John Heinz also has a prominent political career, serving as a Senator from Pennsylvania for the last eight years, and a Congressman near Pittsburgh for five years prior. He is a moderate to liberal Republican to the likes of Nelson Rockefeller, who is strong on issues such as steel protection, Social Security, and others. While Heinz will likely hurt down in Carter Country, Pennsylvania's 25 electoral votes could be paramount to a Dole victory in 1984, as well as the rest of the Midwest.</p>",
