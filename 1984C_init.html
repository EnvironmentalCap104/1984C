The October surprise of getting the hostages out of Iran saved Jimmy Carter's political career. Stagflation has dropped, but that doesn't mean Carter has gotten any more popular. The Republicans have the upper-hand right now due to the economy, unpopularity of Carter, and their hawkish foreign policy ideas.<p><p>Vice President Walter Mondale unsurprisingly wins the Democratic nomination, but in a divided primary with Gary Hart, John Glenn, and others. On the Republican side, Kansas Senator Bob Dole, the 1976 Republican vice presidential nominee, gets the Republican nomination. Can Mondale continue the Carter years? Or is the country ready for a change and will it go for Bob Dole?",

Lay your weary head to rest, don't you cry no more.</i><p>Bob Dole is a charming, honorable, and wholesome man. A lot like Reagan, but more moderate. Someone that the Republicans have always had great respect for on Capitol Hill, and by the voters. Gerry Ford picked him as his running-mate in the 1976 presidential campaign, so Bob's got the experience in running against Carter and Mondale. He has served Kansas in the United States Senate since 1969, the same year Richard Nixon first got elected President, and has increasingly become more moderate in the Republican Party, and a friend of the farmers. Maybe that's what the Republicans need to defeat the liberal Mondale, after it didn't work with a strong conservative like Ronny. Will his efforts be successful? Or will he fall to Fritz?",
